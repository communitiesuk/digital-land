We have started using github issues to manage our work. This helps us with our aim to be as open and inclusive as possible. It helps our users and those who are interested in the project to get involved.

However we still want to surface content on this site. To do that we are using the [Octokit JS Library](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js).

This page is a test page for some of the features of the library that we might use.
