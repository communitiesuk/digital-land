## Current areas of investigation

The following areas of investigation explore how the data could be used and made easier to work with:

{{< in-progress-issue title="Collecting and publishing housing numbers">}}

#### Questions we're asking

What is the best way to collect and publish data from local plans?

#### What we're testing

We’re focussing on one piece of data from local plans. We’ve now collected the housing numbers from most local plans, and are testing a tool to help us publish this data.

#### What we’ve learned

We now know that each local plan varies hugely in structure, format and how the data is presented. This means that finding one piece of information in each local plan can be challenging.

By focussing on finding housing numbers, we have developed efficient ways to find the right data in local plans. This will inform the discovery phase of our wider local plans project.

#### Questions we’re asking

How can we make sure the data we’ve collected is accurate and up to date?

#### What we’ll test

We’re currently building a tool which displays the number of houses each local authority has committed to building. This will allow local authorities a way to check and update their data.

We will send each local authority their housing numbers to confirm the data is correct, or to update the numbers and show where the correct data could have been found. This will help us understand how each authority is publishing their data, and will inform our wider local plans project.

Take a look at what [we’ve built so far](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com) and join our local plans [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/labels/project%3Alocal-plans).

## Timeline

**April 2019**

We collected the [latest housing numbers](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/) from emerging and adopted local plans. We plan to validate these numbers with local planning authorities.

**19 March 2019**

We met with the [Planning Advisory Service](https://www.local.gov.uk/planning-advisory-service), [Greater London Authority](https://www.london.gov.uk/), and [Aecom](https://www.aecom.com/) to discuss the housing delivery test and housing trajectories.
