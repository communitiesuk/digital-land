As part of our wider project on [local plans](/project/local-plans/), weâ€™re collecting and publishing the number of houses each local authority has committed to build. Focussing on just one piece of data will help us to learn how local plans are structured, what challenges there are around collecting data, and how to prioritise the wider local plans project.

We hope that by publishing these numbers in one place, local authorities can easily check and update their data, and other people who are interested can easily find, trust and use the data.
