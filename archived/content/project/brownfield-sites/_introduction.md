Brownfield sites are plots of land that have previously been developed but are not currently in use. [Recent analysis](https://www.cpre.org.uk/resources/housing-and-planning/planning/item/5086-state-of-brownfield-2019) suggests more than 1 million houses could be built on brownfield sites across England.

We're working with local planning authorities to improve the quality of data on brownfield sites, turning what they publish into a national dataset.
