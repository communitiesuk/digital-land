In the 2018 [Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-final-report) there is a recommendation to keep a 'digital record' of information on residential buildings that have 10 or more storeys. Its purpose is to make accurate building information available to those responsible for assessing and demonstrating the safety of buildings.

The Digital Land team and policy teams at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are working with the Building Safety Programme to understand what a 'digital record' might look like, and how the data could be collected and made available.
