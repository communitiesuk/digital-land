{{< in-progress-issue title="How will the infrastructure funding statement be produced?" number="222" >}}

#### Questions we're asking

Each year local planning authorities will have to publish an infrastructure funding statement. This report will use data that has been published throughout the year (using our [guidance](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/developer-contributions/)) to give an annual summary.

Working with local planning authorities we would like to test the content and design of the report, as well as testing a way of building and publishing the report.

#### What we will test

* we have designed some very early mock-ups linked to from our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues/222)
