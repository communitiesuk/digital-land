In the [alpha phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) of this project, we developed a new common  standard for publishing data on developer contributions.

We are proposing a simple data format for developer contributions that:

* meets the user needs weâ€™ve identified
* requires minimal effort from local planning authorities to create and make the data available

You can help us improve the format by:

* joining the discussion on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues)
* making comments using our [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pvblp8l4ODFmv91yyktArGaiskVnJgFcWDCYBBRgc2A/edit)
* following the [proposed guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publish-your-developer-contributions-data) next time you publish your developer contributions

We will continue to develop the format as we learn from testing the format with data and the prototypes with users.

We would particularly like to hear from local planning authorities who are able to make their developer contributions public and would be willing to participate in our user research.
